# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

### run_analysis.R

```run_analysis.R ``` script does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set & appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. From the data set in step 3, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### tinydata.txt

```tinydata.txt ``` is the output of the step 5. The indpendent tidy data set summarizes the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


### CodeBook.md

```CodeBook.md ``` of the tidy data set indicates all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
